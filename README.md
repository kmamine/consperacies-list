61. The CIA-HIV Invention Plot: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was not a natural cross-species transfer but was a biological weapon intentionally engineered by the CIA in a military laboratory.
62. The KGB Disinformation Campaign: The theory that the U.S. government created AIDS was a strategic "active measure" disseminated by the KGB to undermine American credibility and incite global anti-American sentiment.
63. The Ebola Weaponization Theory: The Ebola virus is an artificial pathogen developed and deployed by Western governments or military interests for the purpose of population control or geopolitical manipulation.
64. The Pharmaceutical Disease Manufacturing Scheme: Global pharmaceutical companies participate in the "invention" of medical conditions such as ADHD, HSV, and HPV to create a permanent market for their proprietary drugs and vaccines.

71. The Agenda 21 Depopulation Plot: The United Nations’ Agenda 21 is not a voluntary sustainability plan, but a secretive, legally binding blueprint to abolish private property, end individual car ownership, and forcibly reduce the global population by up to 85%.
72. The Great Reset Economic Coup: The World Economic Forum (WEF) and a "secret group" of global elites manufactured or exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to collapse the current global economy and replace it with a "stakeholder" system where individuals "own nothing" and are entirely dependent on the state.
73. The 15-Minute City Open-Air Prison: The "15-minute city" urban planning model is a pretext to implement permanent "climate lockdowns," where residents are restricted by law from leaving their designated neighborhood zones without government permission.
74. The 5G Surveillance Infrastructure: Sustainable development initiatives serve as a cover for the installation of a global 5G network intended for total population surveillance, digital tracking, and the enforcement of a social credit system.
75. The One-World Government Agenda: International agreements like the Great Reset and Agenda 21 are strategic steps toward dissolving national sovereignty and establishing a centralized, unelected world government that dictates all aspects of human life.
76. The LVU Religious Cleansing Plot: The Swedish state uses the Care of Young Persons Act (LVU) as a weapon to "kidnap" Muslim children from their families for the specific purpose of secularizing them or forcibly converting them to Christianity.
77. The Cultural Assimilation Scheme: Social services intentionally remove children from immigrant households to force them to eat pork, drink alcohol, and prevent girls from wearing the hijab, all in an effort to destroy their Islamic identity.
78. The State-Sanctioned Human Trafficking Theory: Swedish social services are alleged to be involved in a profitable "child-trading" business, where children are "abducted" and sold to non-Muslim families or, in more extreme versions, to pedophile rings.
79. The Racist Selection Strategy: Authorities are accused of bypassing legal standards to specifically target families of foreign origin and Muslim faith, while ignoring similar domestic situations, as part of a broader racist agenda to control the immigrant population.
80. The Global Satanic Cabal: A secretive, global "Deep State" cabal—composed of high-ranking Democratic politicians, Hollywood elites, and "globalist" figures—is operating a massive child sex-trafficking ring. They are alleged to worship Satan and engage in cannibalistic rituals.
81. The Adrenochrome Extraction Theory: Building on the "Blood Libel" trope, the cabal is alleged to kidnap children to harvest a chemical called adrenochrome from their blood at the moment of death. The cabal supposedly imbibes this substance as a psychedelic drug and an elixir of youth.
82. The Savior Trump Narrative: Donald Trump was not just a president, but a messianic figure chosen to wage a secret war against the Deep State. Adherents believe he was recruited by top military generals to dismantle the cabal and restore the "holy nation."
83. "The Storm" and "The Event": An imminent apocalyptic event, often called "The Storm," will involve the mass arrest, military tribunal, and public execution of thousands of cabal members (including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama) on national television.
84. The "Great Awakening": A predicted future moment when the general public will finally realize the "truth" of the QAnon theories, leading to a new age of peace and transparency under the guidance of the mysterious figure "Q."
85. The Secret Arrests/Ankle Monitors: High-profile figures (like the Clintons or John McCain) were already secretly arrested years ago and replaced by clones or actors, with the "originals" wearing GPS ankle monitors hidden under their clothing during public appearances.
86. The MI5 Erasure Plot: Originating in the UK, this theory claims that intelligence agencies like MI5 use the provided pencils to erase "unfavorable" votes and remark them to manipulate election results, particularly during high-stakes referendums like Brexit or Scottish Independence.
87. The Referendum Sabotage Theory: Specifically held by some "Yes" voters in 2014, this claim posits that the Scottish independence referendum failed because pencil-marked ballots were systematically altered by the British state to ensure a "No" victory.
88. The Pauline Hanson "Use Pens" Campaign: In Australia, this theory suggests that the use of pencils at federal polling booths is a deliberate vulnerability introduced by the government to facilitate large-scale voter fraud, a narrative promoted to explain potential losses for the One Nation party.
89. The Ink Transfer Sabotage: A secondary "reverse" theory claims that if a voter uses a pen, the wet ink will smudge onto the other side of the folded ballot, creating a "double mark" that allows corrupt officials to disqualify the vote as invalid.
90. The Golden Billion Resource Appropriation Plot: A secretive cabal of approximately one billion people from the Western "Global North" is conspiring to hoard the Earth's limited resources for themselves. This group allegedly seeks to collapse Russia from within to seize its vast natural wealth and landmass, which they deem necessary for their own survival in a resource-scarce future.
91. The "Artificial Depopulation" Agenda: To maintain a high standard of living for this "Golden Billion," the Western elite supposedly plan to reduce the rest of the world’s population through artificial means, such as engineered economic crises, famines, or biological threats.
92. The "15 Million Russians" Myth: Proponents frequently cite a fake quote attributed to Margaret Thatcher (or sometimes Madeleine Albright), claiming she stated that it is only "economically feasible" for 15 million people to inhabit Russia—implying a Western plan to eliminate or displace nearly 90% of the Russian population.
93. The Neocolonial Subjugation Theory: International organizations (like the IMF and World Bank) and Western "liberal" values are viewed as tools of the Golden Billion designed to keep Russia in a state of "raw-material appendage" and prevent it from becoming a competing global power.
94. The Judeo-Masonic Modernization Plot: The secularist and modernist movements within the Ottoman Empire (such as the Tanzimat and the Young Turks) were not internal efforts to modernize, but a coordinated conspiracy by Jews and Freemasons to dismantle the Islamic Caliphate and weaken Ottoman power.
95. The "Dönme" Identity of Atatürk: Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was allegedly a Dönme (a descendant of secret Jews who converted to Islam in the 17th century). This theory claims his secular reforms—such as the abolition of the Caliphate and the religious courts—were a hidden Jewish agenda to destroy Islamic influence in Turkey.
96. The Greek-British Invasion Deal: As promoted by Kadir Mısıroğlu, the 1919 Greek invasion of Anatolia was a "staged" event resulting from a secret agreement between Atatürk and the United Kingdom. In this theory, the British allowed the Turks to win in exchange for Atatürk agreeing to abolish the Caliphate and secularize the country.
97. The Freemason Revenge Assassination: Atatürk did not die of natural causes (liver cirrhosis) in 1938, but was systematically poisoned by Freemasons. This was allegedly done in retaliation for his 1935 decision to close all Masonic lodges in Turkey.
98. The İsmet İnönü Murder Conspiracy: A 2015 narrative promoted by Yeni Şafak alleges that Atatürk’s successor, İsmet İnönü, was the primary architect of the plot to murder Atatürk to seize power and continue a "deviant" secularist path.
99. The "Children of Moses" International Plot: As detailed in Ergün Poyraz’s bestseller, global Jewish interests (the "international Jewish conspiracy") installed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as Prime Minister. In a paradoxical twist, some secularists used this theory to claim Erdoğan's "moderate Islam" was actually a Zionist tool designed to weaken Turkish secularism from the inside.
100. The "Michael LaVaughn Robinson" Identity Theory: Proponents claim that Michelle Obama was born biologically male with the name "Michael LaVaughn Robinson" and underwent gender reassignment surgery later in life. This theory often relies on manipulated photos or "satirical" articles that have been stripped of their disclaimers.
101. The "Big Mike" Disguise Narrative: Popularized in fringe online communities and by figures like Alex Jones, this theory suggests that the former First Lady uses her public image as a "disguise" and that her "true" identity is a man named "Big Mike."
102. The Joan Rivers "Whistleblower" Theory: Following a 2014 joke by comedian Joan Rivers—who referred to Michelle Obama as "transgender"—conspiracy theorists claim Rivers was actually revealing a "state secret." Her death shortly after the comment is frequently framed as a "silencing" by the Obama administration.
103. The "Secret Son" and Fake Lineage Plot: A variation of the theory claims that Michelle Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, left a secret will identifying a son named "Michael Robinson Obama," supposedly proving that Michelle is actually a man and that the Obama children were not biologically hers.
104. The "Masculinization" Racial Trope: As noted by cultural critics, these theories often intersect with historical racist tropes that attempt to "de-feminize" Black women. Proponents use athletic photos or specific clothing choices as "proof" of a hidden masculine anatomy to discredit her womanhood and the legitimacy of the Obama family.
105. The Quid Pro Quo Prosecution Plot: The central theory alleges that while serving as Vice President, Joe Biden used $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees as leverage to force the Ukrainian government to fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. The motive was supposedly to halt a corruption investigation into Burisma Holdings to protect his son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the company's board.
106. The $10 Million Bribery Scheme: Based on claims from a (later indicted) FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, it was alleged that the owner of Burisma paid $5 million each to Joe and Hunter Biden to ensure Shokin’s removal and to "protect" the company from legal trouble through Joe Biden's political influence.
107. The "Burisma Fixer" Theory: Hunter Biden was allegedly hired by Burisma—despite having no experience in the energy sector—specifically to act as a "shield" or "fixer" who could use his father’s position to influence U.S. foreign policy and shut down criminal cases against the company's oligarch owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.
108. The Italian Energy Contract Lobbying Claim: A 2024 theory, fueled by newly released documents, suggests that Hunter Biden used his father’s office to lobby the U.S. Ambassador to Italy in 2016 to help Burisma secure a geothermal energy project in Tuscany.
109. The Russian Disinformation Origin Theory: Opponents of the Biden-Ukraine claims argue that the entire narrative was a strategic "active measure" by Russian intelligence (distributed through figures like Andrii Derkach) to interfere in U.S. elections and undermine the Biden administration's support for Ukraine.
110. The Ukrainian Election Interference Theory: This theory claims that it was actually Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to benefit Hillary Clinton. It suggests that the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community regarding Russian hacking was a "fictional narrative" designed to delegitimize Donald Trump’s victory.
111. The Hidden DNC Server/CrowdStrike Plot: A specific claim that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server hacked in 2016 was not examined by the FBI but was instead whisked away to Ukraine. It alleges that CrowdStrike—a U.S. cybersecurity firm falsely claimed to be owned by a wealthy Ukrainian—planted evidence on the server to frame Russia for the hack.
112. The "Putin Told Me" Defense: According to former White House officials, Trump explicitly promoted the idea of Ukrainian culpability based on private conversations with Vladimir Putin, asserting that Ukraine was the true aggressor in the 2016 interference campaign.
113. The Burisma Conflict Cover-up: Beyond the Hunter Biden board seat, this theory alleges a "vast network of enemies" within the U.S. government (the "Deep State") worked with Ukrainian officials to manufacture the Russia investigation as a distraction from the Bidens' alleged corruption in Ukraine.
114. The Whistleblower Political Bias Plot: Following the revelation of the Trump–Zelenskyy phone call, allies claimed the anonymous whistleblower was a partisan "material witness" to Biden corruption, and that the entire impeachment inquiry was a "coordinated hit" by the DNC and intelligence agencies to protect the Biden family's interests.
115. The Antifa/Communist Revolution Hoax: A viral theory claimed the shooter was an "Antifa" member who carried an Antifa flag into the church and announced to worshippers, "This is a communist revolution." This narrative was amplified by hyper-partisan blogs and search engine autocomplete suggestions within 24 hours of the event.
116. The "Alt-Left" Political Hit: Various theories falsely identified the shooter as a radicalized supporter of Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, alleging he targeted the First Baptist Church specifically because the congregation consisted of "white conservatives" or "Trump supporters."
117. The "Crisis Actor" / Government Hoax Theory: Similar to theories surrounding Sandy Hook, some conspiracy theorists—including Robert Ussery (known as "SideFocus")—claimed the shooting was a staged "false flag" operation by the U.S. government. They alleged that the victims were "crisis actors" and that the event was fabricated to justify stricter gun control laws.
118. The Radical Muslim Disguise: Early misinformation on social media claimed the shooter was a "radical Muslim" or a recent convert to Islam, despite law enforcement confirming his identity as Devin Patrick Kelley, a former U.S. Air Force member with a history of domestic violence.
119. The "DNC Hit Squad" Narrative: Fringe theorists suggested the shooter was part of a coordinated "hit squad" funded by the Democratic National Committee or George Soros to incite a civil war by attacking religious institutions in "Red States."
120. The "Staged" Squib Theory: Proponents on the political left alleged the shooting was faked by the Republican Party to boost Trump's poll numbers. They claimed he used a "squib" or "blood pill" to create the appearance of a wound and pointed to him posing for a photo with his fist raised as evidence that there was no "real" urgency or danger.
121. The "Joe Biden / Deep State" Hit: Some on the right, including certain members of Congress, alleged that President Biden "sent the orders" for the assassination to eliminate a political rival. This theory suggests the Secret Service was intentionally ordered to leave the rooftop unsecured.
122. The "Jonathan Willis" Stand-down Order: A viral hoax on 4chan claimed a Secret Service sniper named "Jonathan Willis" was ordered by his superiors not to shoot Thomas Crooks until after he had fired at Trump. The Secret Service confirmed they have no employee by that name and that snipers neutralized the shooter within seconds of his first shot.
123. The "Thomas Crooks as a Federal Asset" Theory: Promoted by figures like Tucker Carlson, this theory alleges the FBI is hiding Crooks' "true" digital footprint. Carlson claimed to possess evidence of threats and firearms practice on social media that the FBI supposedly suppressed to hide the fact that Crooks was a "federal asset" or part of a larger state-sponsored plot.
124. The "Second Shooter" Acoustic Theory: Despite FBI findings that all shots came from a single location, some "online sleuths" analyzed audio from the rally to claim there were multiple shooters, suggesting a coordinated crossfire rather than a lone-wolf attack.
125. The Secret Service Complicity Plot: Because the shooter, Ryan Wesley Routh, was able to camp outside the golf course for 12 hours with a rifle, some theorists allege that Secret Service agents "intentionally allowed" him to get within range, despite the golf outing not being on Trump’s public schedule.
126. The "CIA-Ukraine Operative" Narrative: Due to Routh’s high-profile activism for Ukraine and his attempts to recruit foreign fighters, far-right theorists like Laura Loomer suggested he was a CIA intelligence operative. They pointed to a 2023 New York Times interview with Routh as proof that he was "vetted" and "protected" by the Deep State.
127. The "BlackRock Ad" Hoax: A recurring theory falsely claimed that both Thomas Crooks and Ryan Routh appeared in a commercial for the investment firm BlackRock. While Crooks did briefly appear in a 2022 ad filmed at his high school, Routh never appeared in any BlackRock footage; theorists used a video of him at a protest in Kyiv to fabricate a link.
128. The "Time Magazine" Coordination Claim: Following the second attempt, theorists pointed to a Time magazine cover showing Trump in a golf sand trap with the caption "In Trouble" as evidence of "advance knowledge" or "coordination" between the media and the alleged assassins.
129. The Anti-Trump Sabotage Plot: Popularized during the first Trump presidency, this theory claims that a secretive network of career civil servants, intelligence officers (FBI/CIA), and "holdover" appointees from the Obama administration worked together to leak classified information and stall policy reversals to intentionally sabotage the Trump agenda.
130. The Peter Dale Scott "Deep Politics" Framework: This theory posits that behind the "public state" of elected officials lies a more powerful "deep state" composed of financial elites, the military-industrial complex, and intelligence agencies. This network supposedly operates outside of the Constitution and is responsible for major historical events, such as the JFK assassination and the escalation of the Vietnam War.
131. The "Globalist/Satanic" Cabal (QAnon Integration): An extremist version of the theory where the deep state is not just a bureaucracy, but a "Satanic" group of globalist elites involved in child sex trafficking and international financial manipulation. This cabal is alleged to use the "mainstream media" as a tool for population control.
132. The "Unitary Executive" Counter-Conspiracy: Some scholars and critics argue that the claim of a deep state is itself a conspiracy used by authoritarian leaders. In this view, the "deep state" is a "phantom" created to justify "deconstructing" the civil service and centralizing all government power under a single leader.
133. The "Judeo-Bolshevik" Rebranding: Building on older antisemitic tropes like The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, some modern theories frame the deep state as a "Cultural Marxist" or "Zionist" entity designed to dissolve national sovereignty and traditional cultural values in favor of a one-world government.
134. The Frankfurt School "Subversion" Plot: A group of mid-20th-century German-Jewish intellectuals (the Frankfurt School) allegedly fled Nazi Germany not to escape persecution, but to infiltrate American universities and institutions. Their goal was to use "Critical Theory" to systematically dismantle Western Christian values and replace them with a Marxist-inspired culture.
135. The "Political Correctness" as a Biological Weapon: "Political correctness" is not a social movement for inclusivity, but a calculated, "alien" ideology designed by Cultural Marxists to act as a psychological weapon. It is intended to pathologize traditional views and silence any opposition to the destruction of the nuclear family and national identity.
136. The "Theodor Adorno and The Beatles" Myth: In one of the more surreal iterations, theorists like Lyndon LaRouche claimed that Frankfurt School musicologist Theodor Adorno was the secret "fifth Beatle" who wrote the band’s music as part of a plot to use "atonal" pop music to brainwash Western youth into a state of cultural pessimism and drug-fueled rebellion.
137. The "White Genocide" / Great Replacement Connection: As cited in the manifesto of Anders Behring Breivik, Cultural Marxism is viewed as the intellectual engine behind mass immigration and multiculturalism. The theory alleges that by promoting "diversity," Cultural Marxists intend to dilute and eventually eliminate the white, Christian populations of the West.
138. The "Oppressor vs. Oppressed" Transposition: This theory claims that when economic Marxism failed to trigger a revolution among the working class, these theorists "sleight-of-hand" switched their focus to culture. They allegedly replaced "the proletariat" with "identity groups" (LGBTQ+, ethnic minorities) to create a permanent state of social conflict that would collapse the capitalist order.
139. The "Birther" Citizenship Theory: The primary theory claims Obama was not born in Honolulu, Hawaii, but in Kenya, making him ineligible for the U.S. Presidency under the "natural-born citizen" clause of the Constitution. Adherents believe his 1961 birth certificate is a forgery and that birth announcements in Hawaiian newspapers were part of a decades-long "sleeper cell" plot.
140. The "Secret Muslim" Manchurian Candidate: This theory alleges that Obama, while publicly a Protestant Christian, secretly practices Islam. "Evidence" cited by proponents includes his middle name (Hussein), his childhood years in Indonesia, and deceptively edited videos. Some extreme versions claim he was "installed" by radical Islamist groups to weaken America from within.
141. The "Obama Deception" Puppet Theory: Popularized by the 2009 Alex Jones film The Obama Deception, this theory posits that Obama's administration was a "puppet government" for a wealthy global elite (including the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations). It claims his "Hope and Change" platform was a psychological operation to facilitate a "New World Order."
142. The Benghazi "Stand-Down" Conspiracy: Regarding the 2012 attack in Libya, theories allege that the Obama administration intentionally allowed the attack to happen for political reasons or to cover up a secret CIA gun-running operation to Syrian rebels. Some claims suggest a "stand-down" order was given to military rescue teams to ensure the Ambassador's death.
143. The "Obamagate" / Spygate Allegations: Promoted heavily by Donald Trump, this theory claims that the Obama administration "spied" on the 2016 Trump campaign using the FBI and intelligence agencies. It alleges that the entire Russia investigation (Crossfire Hurricane) was a "treasonous" plot to prevent Trump's election or to sabotage his presidency.
144. The "Michael" / Transgender Theory: A fringe theory alleging that Michelle Obama is a man and that Barack Obama’s marriage and children are part of a massive deception. This narrative frequently relies on the "Joan Rivers whistleblower" myth (see the Michelle Obama section).
145. The Public Protector as a CIA Spy: In 2014, Deputy Minister of Defence Kebby Maphatsoe alleged that Public Protector Thuli Madonsela was a CIA agent. He claimed she was being used as a "CEO" for the Americans to destabilize South Africa from within, largely in response to her investigation into President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla estate upgrades.
146. The CIA HIV/AIDS Invention: Former President Thabo Mbeki famously addressed an ANC caucus in 2000, alleging the CIA was working with pharmaceutical companies to promote the link between HIV and AIDS to protect drug profits. This "HIV denialism" became a central pillar of his administration's health policy.
147. The "Third Force" White Supremacist Plot: During the #FeesMustFall student protests in 2016, ANC Youth League leaders and police officials claimed that "white supremacists" were the hidden "third force" driving the strikes to prove that the ANC was unable to govern.
148. The Western Assassination Plot against Jacob Zuma: In 2016, KwaZulu-Natal ANC Youth League leaders claimed they had "uncovered" a plot by Western powers to assassinate President Jacob Zuma. They used this as a justification for calling to expand the South African military into a global superpower.
149. The Bell Pottinger "White Monopoly Capital" Narrative: While partially based on a real PR campaign, this theory alleged that a unified cabal of white business elites (White Monopoly Capital) was the primary cause of South Africa's economic stagnation and was actively conspiring to prevent "Radical Economic Transformation."
150. The "Clinton Body Count" Allegation: A long-standing theory, frequently promoted by right-wing influencers and Donald Trump himself, claims that Bill and Hillary Clinton ordered Epstein’s murder to prevent him from testifying about Bill Clinton's multiple flights on Epstein’s private jet (the "Lolita Express") and his visits to Epstein's private island.
151. The "Trump Deep State" Hit: Conversely, a prominent theory from the political left suggests that the Trump administration’s Department of Justice (under William Barr) facilitated the death to protect Donald Trump and his inner circle from being implicated in Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring.
152. The "Homicidal Strangulation" Forensic Theory: Pathologist Michael Baden, hired by Epstein’s brother Mark, publicly challenged the suicide ruling. He argued that the fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone were more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging, a claim that remains a cornerstone of "murder" theories despite the medical examiner's rebuttal.
153. The "Staged Body" / Body Switch Theory: A fringe theory appearing in 2025 and 2026 suggests that Epstein is actually still alive and "chilling" in a non-extradition country. Proponents claim the autopsy photos show a "decoy" body with different ear and nose shapes, and that the entire suicide was a "grand deception" to allow him to escape.
154. The Blackmail "Kill Switch" Theory: This theory posits that Epstein’s "Little Black Book" and extensive surveillance of his own properties contained enough blackmail material to collapse the global elite. Adherents believe he was killed by a "consortium of elites" (including royals, tech billionaires, and politicians) before he could activate a "kill switch" that would release the footage.
155. The "Body Count" Hit List: A central theory claiming that over 50 (and in some versions, over 100) people with ties to the Clintons have died under "mysterious" circumstances. While the list includes everything from plane crashes to heart attacks, theorists argue these are "professional hits" designed to look like accidents or suicides.
156. The Vince Foster "Murder" Plot: The 1993 suicide of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster is the cornerstone of the movement. Theorists allege he was murdered because he "knew too much" about the Whitewater scandal. Claims include that his body was moved to Fort Marcy Park, that his suicide note was a forgery, and that carpet fibers on his suit proved he was killed elsewhere.
157. The Mena Airport Drug-Running Scheme: Originating in the 1994 film The Clinton Chronicles, this theory alleges that as Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton protected a massive cocaine-smuggling operation at the Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport. It claims he profited from the trade and ordered the deaths of "witnesses," including two teenagers, Don Henry and Kevin Ives, who were found on railroad tracks in 1987.
158. The "Clinton Foundation" Laundering Operation: A more modern theory alleging that the Clinton Foundation is a "slush fund" for a global pay-to-play scheme. Theorists claim the foundation was used to facilitate the sale of 20% of U.S. uranium capacity to Russia (Uranium One) in exchange for donations.
159. The Seth Rich DNC Leak Theory: Following the 2016 election, theorists alleged that DNC staffer Seth Rich was the true source of the leaked DNC emails (not Russian hackers) and was assassinated by a "Clinton-led hit squad" in retaliation.
160. The "Mastermind Hillary" Narrative: Later iterations of these theories, promoted by figures like Larry Nichols, shifted the focus to Hillary Clinton, portraying her as the cold, calculating "mastermind" who handles the "wetwork" (assassinations) while Bill provides the political charisma.
161. The "Crisis Actor" / Staged Hoax Theory: The most pervasive theory, popularized by Alex Jones, claimed the entire shooting was a "synthetic," faked event using professional "crisis actors." Adherents alleged that the grieving parents were performers and that the children involved either never existed or were still alive and living under different names.
162. The "Second Amendment" False Flag: This theory argues the U.S. government orchestrated the event as a "false flag" operation to create a public outcry for stricter gun control. Theorists claimed it was a psychological operation (psy-op) designed to justify the repeal of the Second Amendment and the confiscation of private firearms.
163. The "Zionist Deception" Narrative: Former KKK leader David Duke and others alleged that "Zionists" or "agents of Israel" were behind the shooting. They claimed the event was a "revenge" plot for the perceived cooling of Israel-U.S. relations, using it as a vehicle for antisemitic tropes about global control.
164. The "Operation Closed Campus" Link: Proponents like James Fetzer and James Tracy claimed the shooting was actually a "classified training exercise" modeled on a real-life emergency drill. They pointed to supposed technical "glitches" in news coverage as proof of a scripted production.
165. The Mayan Calendar / Spiritual Panic: Rush Limbaugh and some fringe spiritual groups suggested a link to the "2012 Mayan Apocalypse" phenomenon. They argued the cultural obsession with the "end of the world" on December 21, 2012, may have driven the shooter’s mental collapse or served as the occult backdrop for the tragedy.
166. LIHOP ("Let It Happen On Purpose"): This theory suggests that high-level U.S. officials had specific foreknowledge of the attacks but intentionally "stood down" the military and air defenses to allow them to happen. The alleged motive was to create a "New Pearl Harbor" to justify wars in the Middle East and the expansion of the domestic surveillance state.
167. MIHOP ("Make It Happen On Purpose"): A more extreme view claiming that the U.S. government (or a "Deep State" cabal) actively planned and executed the attacks, using Al-Qaeda as a "front" or framing them entirely.
168. The Stand-Down Order: Theorists point to the failure of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to intercept the hijacked planes as evidence of a deliberate order to remain grounded, despite standard operating procedures for off-course aircraft.
169. Controlled Demolition (Towers 1 & 2): Proponents argue that jet fuel cannot melt steel and that the towers fell too quickly and symmetrically. They claim pre-planted explosives or "nano-thermite" were used to bring the buildings down.
170. The "Mystery" of WTC 7: Building 7 was not hit by a plane but collapsed later that afternoon. Conspiracy theorists frequently cite its "free-fall" acceleration (confirmed for 2.25 seconds by NIST) as "smoking gun" evidence of a controlled demolition.
171. Hologram / "No Planes" Theory: A fringe subset argues that no actual planes hit the towers. Instead, they claim "hologram technology" was used to mask missiles or that the video footage was digitally manipulated in real-time.
172. The Pentagon Missile Claim: Popularized by the book 9/11: The Big Lie, this theory asserts that the hole in the Pentagon was too small for a Boeing 757 and that no wreckage or engines were found. It claims a global-positioning missile or a smaller military craft was the true culprit.
173. Flight 93 Shot Down: Regarding the plane that crashed in Shanksville, PA, theorists claim it did not crash due to a passenger revolt but was actually shot down by U.S. fighter jets, with the "heroic struggle" narrative being a later invention to cover up the friendly fire.
174. The "Jacobin Mastermind" Theory (The Grand Conspiracy): This is the foundation of all modern Illuminati theories. In 1797, two authors—Abbé Augustin Barruel (a French Jesuit) and John Robison (a Scottish scientist)—published separate books claiming that the French Revolution was not a spontaneous uprising, but a "triple conspiracy" of Sophists, Freemasons, and the Illuminati. They alleged that the Illuminati had infiltrated Masonic lodges to use them as a cover for a plot to overthrow all European monarchies and the Catholic Church.
175. The "Survival and Infiltration" Narrative: Despite being banned by the Elector of Bavaria in 1785, theorists like Göchhausen claimed the order survived underground. This theory posits that the Illuminati didn't disappear but merged with the Grand Orient branch of Freemasonry to orchestrate a "New World Order" characterized by atheism, the abolition of private property, and the dissolution of national borders.
176. The "Sisterhood" and Gender Subversion Plot: John Robison specifically warned of an Illuminati "project for a Sisterhood." He alleged that the group intended to recruit women to act as "subservient" agents to degrade the social status of the family and traditional religious morality.
177. The "Atheist Materialism" Scientific Plot: Robison, a scientist himself, believed that prominent Enlightenment figures like Antoine Lavoisier were secretly "Master Illuminists." He argued that the new chemical and biological sciences of the time were actually tools of the Illuminati designed to promote materialism and strip humanity of its spiritual soul.
178. The "Jewish-Masonic-Illuminati" Synthesis: By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European antisemitic writers integrated the Illuminati into the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" framework. This version claimed the Illuminati were the intellectual architects of a Jewish-led plot to dominate the world through financial control and social chaos.
179. The "False Flag" Assassination Attempt: Following the July 2024 shooting in Butler, PA, some "BlueAnon" proponents claimed the event was staged by Trump himself to boost his poll numbers. Theories suggested he used a "blood pill" (squib) or that the shooter was a "coached asset."
180. The Starlink Election Rigging Theory: Some theorists believe Trump conspired with Elon Musk to use Starlink satellites to manipulate vote counts in the 2024 election, subsequently "orbitally detonating" the satellites to destroy the evidence.
181. The "Ivana Coffin" Document Cache: A viral theory claims that Trump did not actually bury his late wife, Ivana Trump, at his Bedminster golf course for sentimental reasons, but rather used her oversized casket to hide self-incriminating classified documents from the FBI.
182. The "JD Vance Replacement" Plot: A narrative popularized by some political influencers suggesting that a cabal of Silicon Valley billionaires intends to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump shortly after his inauguration, replacing him with JD Vance as their "puppet" president.
183. The "Shadow Occupation": Despite the 118th Battalion being officially disbanded or moved years earlier, some residents believed the soldiers never actually left. They claimed the battalion remained in a clandestine capacity to enforce "British loyalty" on the largely German-descended population.
184. The "Kaiser's Bust" Cover-up: After soldiers from the 118th stole a bronze bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I from Victoria Park in 1916, rumors persisted that the battalion held onto the bust as a "trophy of subjugation." Conspiracy theorists claimed the battalion used the bust in secret rituals to exert psychological control over local German-Canadian politicians.
185. Political Sabotage: Decades after the war, local political losses by German-Canadians were often blamed on the "lingering influence" or secret "blacklists" maintained by former 118th officers who allegedly still pulled the strings of the Kitchener City Council.
186. The "False Flag" Template: Theorists argue that the government stages "mass casualty events" using professional actors to create a public emotional response that justifies unpopular policies, most notably gun control.
187. James Tracy and the "Memory Hole": Former professor James Tracy popularized the term after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. He claimed that because some parents appeared "too calm" or "too rehearsed" in interviews, they were actually "itinerant crisis actors" hired from acting agencies like VisionBox.
188. The "David Hogg" Operative Claim: Following the 2018 Parkland shooting, survivors like David Hogg were labeled "FBI-trained actors." Theorists pointed to his father's former career in the FBI as "proof" that he was a plant designed to dismantle the Second Amendment.
189. Recycled Faces: A common (and debunked) trope in these circles involves side-by-side photos of different tragedy victims, claiming they are the "same person" appearing at multiple scenes (e.g., claiming a woman at the Aurora shooting also appeared at Sandy Hook and the Boston Marathon).
190. Historical Continuity: The theory posits that modern Western foreign policy is not driven by secular interests, but is a direct, spiritual continuation of the Medieval Crusades.
191. The "Judeo-Christian" Alliance: Proponents often allege a coordinated "Judeo-Christian" campaign (often involving the U.S., Israel, and Europe) designed to slaughter Muslims and plunder their resources.
192. Symbolic Language: Groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS frequently refer to Western military forces as "Crusaders" to frame modern conflicts as a holy war of defense.
193. Internal Sabotage: A critical element of the theory involves the targeting of "false Muslims" (munafiqun). These are often identified as the leaders of Muslim-majority countries who cooperate with the West.
194. Apostasy and "Agent" Claims: Figures like Sayyid Qutb argued that any leader who does not implement strict Sharia law is a "Western agent" or "puppet" installed to weaken the Ummah (global Muslim community) from within.
195. The "Near Enemy": This narrative justifies violence against fellow Muslims by labeling them as collaborators in the global conspiracy to destroy Islam.
196. Moral Corruption: Beyond military action, the theory alleges a "soft war" (harb na'ima) involving the intentional spread of Western entertainment, secular education, and women's rights to "corrupt" Islamic morals and loosen the grip of faith.
197. Educational Infiltration: Some versions claim that Western-funded schools and NGOs are "Trojan horses" designed to replace Islamic identity with "atheistic materialism" or "Western individualism."
198. The "Lost Years" Journey (Ages 13–29): This theory, popularized by Nicolas Notovitch in his 1894 book The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ, claims Jesus left Judea at age 13 to study the laws of the Buddha and the Vedas in India, Nepal, and Tibet before returning to Jerusalem at age 29.
199. The "Life of Saint Issa" Manuscript: Notovitch claimed to have found a hidden manuscript at the Hemis Monastery in Ladakh, India, detailing the life of "Saint Issa" (Jesus), though the monastery’s monks later denied he had ever visited and the manuscript has never been produced.
200. The "Swoon" Hypothesis (Survival of the Cross): Proponents like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, argue that Jesus did not die on the cross but entered a state of "swoon" or deep unconsciousness, was revived in the tomb, and then traveled East to escape Roman persecution.
201. The Search for the "Lost Tribes of Israel": A central motive in these theories is that Jesus traveled to Afghanistan and Kashmir specifically to preach to the "Lost Tribes of Israel," who were believed by some 19th-century theorists to have settled in those regions.
202. The Roza Bal Shrine in Srinagar: Theorists claim the Roza Bal shrine in downtown Srinagar, Kashmir, is the actual tomb of Jesus. They identify the person buried there, known locally as "Yuz Asaf," as Jesus under a different name.
203. The Age 120 Death Claim: Unlike the biblical account of the Ascension at age 33, this theory posits that Jesus lived a long life in Kashmir, continuing his ministry as a holy man until his natural death at approximately 120 years of age.
204. The Hebrew Burial Alignment: Proponents argue the tomb at Roza Bal is aligned East-to-West in the Jewish tradition, rather than North-to-South in the Islamic tradition, suggesting the occupant was of Hebrew origin.
205. The "Bhavishya Purana" Reference: Theorists often cite a passage in this Hindu text which mentions a meeting between a King Shalivahana and "Isa-Masih" (Jesus the Messiah) in the mountains, interpreting it as historical evidence of his presence in the Himalayas.
206. The "Yusmarg" and "Pahalgam" Etymology: Claims are frequently made that local place names in Kashmir are linguistic evidence of Jesus' visit, such as Yusmarg ("The Meadow of Jesus") and Pahalgam ("The Village of the Shepherd").
207. The Love Jihad (Romeo Jihad) Recruitment Plot: This theory posits that Muslim men engage in a coordinated campaign to feign romantic interest in non-Muslim women specifically to force their conversion to Islam through marriage.
208. The "Organized Predation" Financial Reward: Some proponents of the Love Jihad theory claim that Islamic organizations provide financial incentives or "bounties" to men who successfully marry and convert Hindu or Christian women.
209. The Eurabia Demographic Subversion: Popularized by Bat Ye'or, this theory alleges a secret pact between European leaders and Arab powers to "Islamize" Europe in exchange for favorable oil prices and economic stability.
210. The "Great Replacement" Migration Strategy: Within the Eurabia framework, mass immigration from Muslim-majority countries is viewed not as a refugee crisis, but as an intentional "colonization" tool designed to replace native European populations.
211. The "Dhimmitude" of European Elites: Theorists argue that European bureaucrats have intentionally surrendered their cultural heritage and legal systems to Islamic influence, turning Europe into a "vassal state" of the Arab world.
212. The Barack Obama "Secret Muslim" Manchurian Candidate: This theory claims that the 44th U.S. President was a "sleeper agent" who practiced Islam in secret while using his Christian faith as a political "cover" to infiltrate the American government.
213. The "Taqiyya" Infiltration Myth: Proponents of the "Secret Muslim" narrative often cite a distorted version of the Islamic concept of taqiyya to argue that Muslim politicians are religiously encouraged to lie about their faith to gain power in the West.
214. The "No-Go Zones" Territorial Claim: A persistent myth alleging that certain neighborhoods in Europe and the U.S. have become "Sharia-controlled" areas where local police and non-Muslims are barred from entering.

216. The "Trojan Horse" Educational Takeover: A narrative claiming that Islamic hardliners systematically infiltrate the boards of public schools to radicalize the curriculum and remove secular or Western cultural influences.
217. The "Mark of the Beast" Global Surveillance Plot: This theory claims the Antichrist will enforce a global system of economic control, identified as the "Mark of the Beast," which modern theorists frequently link to microchips, CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), or AI-driven social credit systems.
218. The "False Peacemaker" Infiltration: A common narrative suggests the Antichrist will rise as a charismatic world leader who solves the Middle East crisis and unites religions under a "One World Religion" before revealing his true identity as a tyrant.
219. The "Apollyon" Napoleon Theory: During the early 19th century, many viewed Napoleon Bonaparte as the Antichrist because his "Grand Empire" dismantled the traditional Christian monarchies of Europe, which theorists saw as the "letting" force mentioned in prophecy.
220. The "Secret Muslim" Antichrist Motif: A specific variation of the Obama conspiracy claims that he was the Antichrist because his name or background supposedly "coded" for the biblical "Beast of the Sea" in numerological interpretations.
221. The Trump "Lawless One" Allegation: Some modern religious and "BlueAnon" critics argue that Donald Trump's rhetoric and the "mortal wound" of his 2024 assassination attempt (which he survived) mirror the description of the Beast in the Book of Revelation whose "fatal wound was healed."
222. The Witch-Cult "Indigenocide" Theory: Proposed by Margaret Murray, this theory suggests that the Early Modern witch trials were a coordinated "gynocide" by the Church to exterminate a surviving, pre-Christian pagan religion that worshipped a fertility god.
223. Himmler’s "H-Sonderkommando" Propaganda Project: Between 1935 and 1944, Heinrich Himmler’s SS unit collected over 33,000 witch-trial records to "prove" a conspiracy theory that the Catholic Church was a "Jewish instrument" used to destroy Germanic racial heritage.
224. The "Witch Library" of Prague Myth: Following the 2016 discovery of 13,000 books in a Czech depot, a viral theory claimed it was Himmler's "occult library" containing lost pagan secrets; researchers later clarified most were confiscated Masonic texts with no occult "spells."
225. The "Christianity as a Jewish Virus" Racial Theory: Some far-right esoteric groups claim that the Apostle Paul (a Jew) created Christianity specifically to "weaken" the Aryan race with a "slave morality" that led to the collapse of the Roman Empire.
226. The "9 Million Witches" Demographic Hoax: A persistent fringe claim used by both Himmler and modern radical feminists that 9 million women were burned in the trials; historians note this number was fabricated to exaggerate the "Christian conspiracy" against women.
227. The "H-Special Order" Scientific Cover: Himmler’s researchers claimed to use "scientific" methods to prove that "witches" were actually Aryan "wise women" and natural healers who were the spiritual leaders of a superior Nordic-Germanic race.
228. The Blood Libel and "Ritual Sacrifice" Myth: Originating in the 12th century, this theory falsely claims that Jewish people kidnap and murder Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals, a narrative that has recently been modernized by QAnon’s "adrenochrome" harvesting claims.
229. The "Well Poisoning" Plague Narrative: During the Black Death (1347–1351), a widespread conspiracy theory alleged that Jews were poisoning public wells to destroy Christendom; as of 2022, 20% of people in Great Britain still believed a variation that COVID-19 was a Jewish or Israeli plot.

235. The "Reptilian Shapeshifter" Bloodline Theory: Popularized by David Icke, this theory claims that a race of "interdimensional lizards" controls the world; Icke specifically identifies the Rothschild family as part of this reptilian bloodline, which critics cite as a "coded" form of antisemitism.
236. The "Khazar Hypothesis" and "Imposter" Theory: Often promoted by certain extremist groups, this theory claims that modern Ashkenazi Jews are not "real" Jews but descendants of 8th-century Khazars, used to delegitimize the Jewish connection to the Land of Israel.
237. The "Kosher Tax" Consumer Fraud Myth: A theory alleging that the "U" or "K" symbols on food packaging represent a secret "tax" paid by non-Jewish consumers to Jewish religious organizations to fund a global takeover.

240. The "Killer" Hamas Dolphin: In 2022, Hamas released a video claiming to have captured an Israeli-trained dolphin equipped with a harness and a "speargun-like" weapon; a similar claim was made in 2015 involving a dolphin allegedly carrying a camera and a projectile launcher.
241. The "Zionist Plot" Griffon Vulture: In 2011, a griffon vulture was "arrested" in Saudi Arabia after being found with a GPS tracking device labeled "Tel Aviv University," leading to national headlines about a Mossad espionage plot before officials confirmed it was part of a migration study.
242. The Hezbollah "Spying" Eagles: In 2013, Hezbollah claimed to have shot down a "spy eagle" in Lebanon, providing footage of a bird with a GPS transmitter; Israeli ornithologists later identified it as an endangered Bonelli’s eagle they had been tracking for research.
243. The "Atomic Wave" Spying Lizards: In 2018, Hassan Firouzabadi, a senior military advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader, claimed that Western spies (including Israelis) used chameleons and lizards whose skin could "attract atomic waves" to monitor Iran's secret nuclear sites.
244. The Turkish "Microchip" Bee-Eater: In 2012, villagers in Turkey found a dead European bee-eater with a metal leg band marked "Israel"; local officials initially claimed the bird’s "enlarged nostrils" were evidence of implanted audio-visual surveillance microchips.
245. The Sudanese "Hebrew-Tagged" Vulture: In 2012, Sudanese authorities captured a vulture in the town of Kereinek, alleging it was an Israeli spy because it was tagged in Hebrew and equipped with a "German-made" GPS chip used for reconnaissance.

249. The Titanic Inquiry "Whitewash" Theory: This theory alleges that the 1912 British inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic was a Masonic cover-up designed to protect the White Star Line; it highlights that the presiding judge (Lord Mersey), the President of the Board of Trade, and the chairman of the shipyard that built the ship were all high-ranking Freemasons.
250. The Jack the Ripper "Masonic Ritual" Theory: Popularized by author Stephen Knight and later Bruce Robinson, this theory claims the 1888 Whitechapel murders were Masonic ritual killings intended to protect the Royal Family; it suggests the victims' mutilations mimicked Masonic penalties and that the investigation was stymied by the Masonic Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Charles Warren.
251. The "Juwes" Graffiti Cryptogram: A central piece of the Ripper conspiracy involves graffiti found near a crime scene stating, "The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing," which theorists claim refers not to Jews, but to the "Three Ruffians" of Masonic lore (Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum).
252. Samuel Morse’s "Foreign Conspiracy" Claim: In his 1835 book, Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States, the inventor of the telegraph argued that Freemasonry was a "nursery of destructive principles" and part of a larger Jesuit-led plot to undermine American democracy.

The "Propaganda Due" (P2) Financial Scandal: Theorists often point to the real-life 1981 P2 lodge scandal in Italy—where a "black" Masonic lodge was found to be a "shadow government" involved in bank failures and assassinations—as proof that Freemasons globally control the judiciary and economy.
255. The Washington D.C. "Street Map" Occultism: A popular architectural theory claiming that the street layout of Washington D.C. (designed by Freemason Pierre L'Enfant) contains hidden Masonic symbols like the square and compass and an inverted pentagram intended to focus "occult energy" on the U.S. Capitol.
256. The "Tax Protester" Masonic Plot: Some modern anti-government groups in the U.S. claim that federal income tax and the IRS are illegal tools created by a Masonic-Zionist cabal to strip citizens of their property and achieve total social control.

264. The "European Migrant Crisis" Orchestration: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has accused Soros of having a secret "Soros Plan" to flood Europe with millions of Muslim migrants to destroy the continent’s Christian identity and national borders.
265. The "Great Replacement" Gateway: Soros is frequently identified as the primary "globalist" financier of the Great Replacement theory, which claims a Jewish cabal is replacing white, Christian populations with non-white immigrants.
266. The "Bought" Judiciary / Alvin Bragg Theory: During the 2024–2026 U.S. political cycle, theorists have alleged that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and other "progressive" prosecutors were "bought and paid for" by Soros to carry out political prosecutions against Donald Trump.
267. The "Manchurian Candidate" Political Influence: Claims that Soros "owns" the Democratic Party and uses his donations to ensure that candidates like Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton act as his personal agents to weaken American power.

269. The "COVID-19 Political Agenda" Theory: During the pandemic, viral claims suggested that Soros conspired with Bill Gates to manufacture the virus or use the global response to enforce a "New World Order" and eliminate national sovereignty.
270. The "Gaza Campus Protest" Funding Myth: As of 2025, theories have circulated alleging that Soros is the secret hand behind student protests regarding the Levant conflict, with critics claiming he "pays" students to occupy campus grounds.
271. The 9/11 and The Simpsons / Johnny Bravo Connection: Theorists frequently cite a 1997 episode of The Simpsons where a magazine cover displays the number 9 next to the Twin Towers (forming "9/11") and a 2001 Johnny Bravo episode featuring a poster of a burning building with the words "Coming Soon" as "proof" of prior knowledge.
272. The Die Hard and The Lone Gunmen 9/11 Theory: This theory highlights that the pilot episode of The Lone Gunmen (aired March 2001) featured a plot to hijack a commercial airliner and fly it into the World Trade Center, claiming it was used to "normalize" the imagery of the attacks.
273. The Contagion and COVID-19 Narrative: Predictive programming adherents claim the 2011 film Contagion—which depicts a global pandemic originating from a bat in an Asian wet market—was produced to prepare the public for the lockdowns and social distancing measures implemented in 2020.
274. The "Snake Eyes" and Charlie Kirk Assassination Theory: Following the September 10, 2025, assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, a viral theory emerged linking the event to the 1998 film Snake Eyes; theorists point to a character named "Charles Kirkland" who is assassinated during a public event in the film as a deliberate "script" for the real-life shooting.
275. The Blue Gender / Anime Conditioning: Fringe theories involving the anime Blue Gender suggest its depiction of a global "culling" of humanity and the rise of a new world government was intended to condition viewers to accept large-scale population reduction and the loss of national sovereignty.
276. The 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony: A popular theory claims the ceremony’s "tribute to the NHS"—which featured hospital beds, dancing nurses, and a giant "demon" figure—was predictive programming for a future biological attack or the 2020 pandemic.
277. The Akira / 2020 Tokyo Olympics Prediction: Theorists often point to the 1988 anime Akira, which correctly predicted that Tokyo would host the 2020 Olympics and featured a sign that read "Just cancel it!" as evidence that the "timeline" of the pandemic was pre-planned decades in advance.
278. The Cyberpunk 2077 / Neural Link Conditioning: This theory suggests that modern sci-fi media depicting "neural interfaces" and transhumanism is designed to make the public eager to adopt brain-chip technology (like Neuralink) by framing it as "cool" or inevitable.
279. The "Planned False Flag" Motif: The overarching belief that "the elites" are religiously or occultly bound to "show their work" before committing an act, making predictive programming a form of "revelation of the method" to avoid spiritual karma.
280. The "One World Government" End Goal: The core of the theory claims that international elites aim to dissolve national sovereignty in favor of a unified global state, complete with a single currency, one military, and a centralized judicial system.
281. The World Economic Forum and "The Great Reset": Following the COVID-19 pandemic, theorists seized on the WEF’s "Great Reset" initiative, claiming it is a blueprint for "techno-feudalism" where private property is abolished (popularized by the phrase "You will own nothing and be happy") and populations are managed via a social credit system.
282. The "Digital Control Stack" (CBDCs and ID): In 2024–2026, the theory has shifted toward Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and biometric digital IDs, with proponents arguing these tools will be used by the NWO to track every transaction and "de-bank" or "switch off" anyone who dissents from the global agenda.
283. The "Bavarian Illuminati" Foundation: Many NWO theories trace their origins back to Adam Weishaupt’s 18th-century secret society, claiming it never truly disbanded but instead infiltrated the highest levels of banking, politics, and the arts to guide history from the shadows.
284. The "Bohemian Grove" and Pagan Rituals: Every July, influential men meet at a private campground in California for the "Cremation of Care" ceremony; theorists like Alex Jones claim this is not just theater but an occult ritual where global leaders pledge allegiance to a "pagan elite" agenda.
285. The "Skull and Bones" Pipeline: Critics point to the Yale secret society "Skull and Bones" (Order 322) as a primary recruitment ground for the NWO, highlighting that the 2000 U.S. election featured two members (George W. Bush and John Kerry) as "proof" that the elite choose both sides of a political contest.
286. The "Celebrity Infiltration" and Industry Symbols: Viral theories claim that A-list musicians like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and Rihanna use "Masonic" hand gestures (the triangle/pyramid) and occult imagery in music videos to signal their allegiance to the NWO and condition the youth to accept globalist values.
287. The "Manufactured Crisis" Strategy: Adherents believe the NWO uses "Hegelian Dialectic" (Problem-Reaction-Solution), where they intentionally create a crisis (such as a pandemic, war, or economic crash) to make the public desperate enough to accept "solutions" that strip away their freedoms.
288. The "Georgia Guidestones" Population Control: Until their destruction in 2022, these granite monuments were cited as the NWO’s "Ten Commandments," specifically the instruction to maintain humanity under 500 million, which theorists claim proves a plan for mass depopulation.
289. The "Antichrist" and Religious Overtones: In many Christian circles, the NWO is viewed as the "Beast System" foretold in the Book of Revelation, with the "New World Order" being the political platform from which the Antichrist will eventually rule.
290. The "Bilderberg Group" and "Le Cercle" Secret Meetings: These invitation-only conferences of political and financial leaders are viewed as "shadow cabinets" where national policies are dictated by the NWO without democratic oversight or media transparency.
291. The "Inside Job" Hand Signal Theory: Viral videos from the event focus on two men standing directly behind Kirk—one adjusting his white cap and ear while holding a phone, and another in a black shirt tugging his sleeve; theorists claim these were "coordinated signals" to a sniper to confirm Kirk was in the crosshairs.
292. The "Epstein Files" Silencing Plot: Some commentators, including those on the far-right, allege that Kirk was killed because he had recently begun calling for the full disclosure of the "Epstein files" and allegedly told associates he feared for his life due to the secrets he was uncovering.
293. The Israeli/Mossad Involvement Claim: Promoted by figures like Stew Peters and Maram Susli, this theory suggests Mossad ordered the hit because Kirk was reportedly "turning against" the pro-Israel cause; Benjamin Netanyahu has personally denounced these claims as "monstrous big lies."
294. The "Ukraine Revenge" Narrative: Following the assassination, high-ranking Russian officials like Dmitry Medvedev suggested that the "radical left" or Ukrainian agents killed Kirk because of his staunch opposition to U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine.
295. The "Scripted" Confession Texts: After the FBI released text messages from suspect Tyler Robinson allegedly confessing to the murder, both left-wing and right-wing influencers claimed the texts were "scripted" by federal authorities because the "language and tone" did not match a 22-year-old.
296. The "Snake Eyes" Predictive Programming: A fringe theory identifies the 1998 film Snake Eyes as predictive programming, noting the film features an assassination of a character named "Charles Kirkland" during a public event, which theorists claim provided the blueprint for the real-world hit.
297. The "Transgender Psy-Op" Claim: Since the suspect's partner was described in court documents as transitioning, some theorists claim the entire event was a "false flag" designed to demonize the LGBTQ+ community or justify new "domestic terrorism" laws targeting activists.
298. The "9/11 Eve" Ritual Theory: Adherents of numerology and "occult signaling" claim the date of the assassination—September 10, exactly one day before the 9/11 anniversary—was chosen to maximize the psychological impact and signal "renewal" to a global cabal.
299. The Tucker Carlson "Jesus Parallel": During the memorial service, Tucker Carlson compared Kirk's death to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; critics accused Carlson of using this metaphor to subtly validate the theory that "powerful people" (interpreted by some as a coded reference to Jewish groups) were responsible.
300. The "Double Standard" Half-Staff Theory: When President Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff for Kirk but not for the recently assassinated Democratic Speaker Melissa Hortman, theorists claimed this proved Kirk was an "official martyr" in a larger, pre-planned civil conflict.
301. The "Grassy Knoll" and the Second Gunman: This is the most enduring theory, fueled by over 50 witnesses who claimed to hear shots or see smoke coming from the wooden fence on the grassy knoll, implying a crossfire rather than a single shooter from behind.
302. The "Magic Bullet" Skepticism: Critics argue the "Single Bullet Theory"—which posits that one bullet (CE 399) caused seven separate wounds in both JFK and Governor Connally—is ballistically impossible, suggesting instead that multiple shots were fired in rapid succession.
303. The CIA "Retaliation" Plot: This theory alleges that rogue elements within the CIA killed Kennedy because he "betrayed" the agency at the Bay of Pigs, fired Director Allen Dulles, and reportedly planned to "splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces."
304. The Mafia "Contract" Theory: Proponents claim Mob bosses like Carlos Marcello and Santo Trafficante Jr. ordered the hit because Robert Kennedy’s Department of Justice was relentlessly prosecuting organized crime despite the Mafia's alleged help in winning JFK the 1960 election.
305. The Lyndon B. Johnson "Power Grab" Claim: Popularized by authors like Roger Stone, this theory suggests LBJ orchestrated the assassination to avoid being dropped from the 1964 ticket and to escape various looming corruption scandals that would have ended his career.
306. The "Fidel Castro" Revenge Theory: This narrative suggests the Cuban leader ordered the hit as a counter-move to the multiple CIA-led assassination attempts against him, a theory notably entertained by LBJ himself during his presidency.
307. The "Umbrella Man" Signal Myth: Theorists point to a man seen opening a black umbrella on a sunny day just as the motorcade passed, claiming he was a "signaler" to the various shooters or that the umbrella was a disguised weapon used to fire a paralytic dart.
308. The Lee Harvey Oswald "Patsy" Defense: Based on Oswald's own words ("I'm just a patsy"), this theory claims he was a low-level intelligence asset framed by the real conspirators to provide a convenient Marxist scapegoat for the crime.
309. The "Secret Service Accident" Theory: A fringe but persistent claim that a Secret Service agent in the follow-up car accidentally discharged his AR-15 rifle after the first shot was fired, inadvertently delivering the fatal head wound to the President.
310. The "Badge Man" and the Grassy Knoll Sniper: Some analysts claim that highly magnified photos of the grassy knoll reveal a figure in a police-like uniform (nicknamed "Badge Man") firing a weapon, suggesting local law enforcement complicity.
311. The "Oswald Impersonator" in Mexico City: This theory alleges that a man posing as Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City weeks before the assassination to create a "paper trail" linking the real Oswald to foreign communist powers.
312. The "Babushka Lady" and Confiscated Evidence: A woman seen filming the assassination at close range was never identified; theorists claim the FBI or Secret Service confiscated her film because it contained clear evidence of shooters from multiple directions.
313. The Paul Landis 2023 "Stretcher Bullet" Revelation: In 2023, former Secret Service agent Paul Landis claimed he found the "magic bullet" in the back of the limousine, not on the stretcher, a detail that theorists argue collapses the official ballistic timeline of the Warren Commission.
314. The "Eco-Terrorist" False Flag: Promoted by radio host Rush Limbaugh and various conservative commentators, this theory alleged that environmentalists or "eco-warriors" sabotaged the rig to create a disaster so catastrophic it would force the passage of stalled cap-and-trade climate legislation.
315. The "Earth Day" Ritual Theory: Adherents of this theory pointed to the timing of the explosion (April 20) and the subsequent detection of the massive leak on April 22—Earth Day—as evidence that the event was a "human sacrifice" or a staged ritual to empower the global environmental movement.
316. The North Korean Submarine Strike: A viral narrative, often citing a purported "Russian Ministry of Natural Resources" report, claimed that a North Korean midget submarine fired a "string-fused" torpedo at the rig to retaliate against the U.S. and South Korea following the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan earlier that year.
317. The Russian "Tectonic Weapon" Claim: Some fringe theorists alleged that the spill was caused by a Russian "acoustic-seismic" weapon designed to collapse the sea floor and trigger a massive tsunami that would wipe out the Eastern United States.
318. The "Corexit" Visual Cover-Up: Critics of the cleanup effort, such as the Government Accountability Project, argued that the massive use of the dispersant Corexit was a conspiracy by BP and the Obama administration to "hide" the oil by sinking it below the surface, making the disaster appear smaller to satellite imaging while causing more toxic damage to the deep-sea ecosystem.
319. The "Staged Crisis" for Martial Law: During the peak of the spill, theories circulated on sites like WorldNetDaily suggesting the disaster was being used as a pretext for FEMA to declare martial law along the Gulf Coast and move residents into "detention camps."
320. The "Cursed by God" Zionist Theory: Christian Zionist commentators like Hal Lindsey and Rick Gallups suggested the spill was a divine curse placed on America because the Obama administration had recently signaled it would no longer automatically support Israel at the United Nations.
321. The "Internal Sabotage" for Stock Profit: A theory prevalent in financial circles alleged that BP insiders or rival oil companies intentionally caused the explosion to "short" BP stock, pointing to unusual trading patterns in the days leading up to the disaster.
322. The "Deep Sea Methane" Doomsday: A persistent internet rumor claimed that the "Macondo" well had tapped into a prehistoric methane bubble so large that it threatened to crack the Earth's crust, causing a global extinction event that the government was actively hiding from the public.
323. The "Switch" or "Clone" Theory: One of the most radical claims suggests that MH370 did not crash in the Indian Ocean but was hijacked and hidden, only to be reintroduced months later as MH17 to be intentionally shot down over Ukraine for political leverage.
324. The Diego Garcia Landing Site: A persistent theory claims that MH370 was diverted to the remote U.S. military base on the Diego Garcia atoll, with theorists citing a "deleted" passenger photo and eyewitness reports from the Maldives of a low-flying "blue and red" jet.
325. The "Netanyahu/Israel" Responsibility Claim: American theorist James H. Fetzer alleged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was behind the MH370 disappearance, claiming the operation was intended to distract from geopolitical events or secure valuable semiconductor patents held by passengers.
326. The "Uninterruptible Autopilot" Antarctica Theory: Historian Norman Davies suggested that hackers used a "backdoor" in Boeing’s remote-control technology to take over the plane and fly it to a secret location in Antarctica to hide its "valuable cargo."
327. The "HIV/AIDS Truth" Suppression: Because several prominent HIV researchers (including Joep Lange) were on MH17, a theory emerged that the plane was targeted to prevent the announcement of a "cure" for AIDS or to hide the "truth" about the virus's origin.
328. The "Zombie Plane" / Pre-Loaded Bodies Theory: Russian separatist leaders and state media once claimed that MH17 was filled with "rotting corpses" rather than live passengers before it took off, suggesting the crash was a staged "macabre" theatrical performance to frame Russia.
329. The "Freescale Semiconductor" Patent Plot: This theory claims 20 employees of Freescale Semiconductor were on MH370 and that their disappearance allowed the patent for a "cloaking technology" to revert entirely to the company (and its alleged billionaire owners, like the Rothschilds).
330. The "Russian Remote Hijack" to Kazakhstan: Science journalist Jeff Wise proposed that MH370’s satellite data was "spoofed" by Russian agents who hijacked the plane through the electronics bay and flew it to the Yubileyniy airfield in Kazakhstan on Vladimir Putin’s orders.
331. The "Operation Trojan Horse" Shoot-down: Some theories posit that MH370 was shot down by the U.S. or Thailand during the "Cobra Gold" military exercise to prevent it from being used as a "flying bomb" against a regional target.
332. The "Ukrainian Air Force" Frame-Up: Early Russian narratives regarding MH17 claimed that a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet was spotted on radar "climbing toward" the airliner to shoot it down, a claim later debunked by flight data and shrapnel analysis showing a Buk missile strike.
333. The "Illuminati" Numerology Connection: Theorists point to the "triple 7" (Boeing 777) and the date of MH17's crash (7/17/2014) as evidence of an Illuminati ritual, noting that the flight had been in service for exactly 17 years to the day.
334. The SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program) Label: This is the formal name used by conspiracy theorists and analyzed in scientific studies to describe a purported clandestine operation to inject aerosols into the atmosphere at a global scale.
335. The "Toxic Trio" (Aluminum, Barium, and Strontium): Proponents claim that air and soil samples prove the government is spraying these heavy metals; scientists counter that these elements are naturally occurring in the crust and that "chemtrail" sampling methods are often contaminated by the metal containers used by amateurs.
336. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) "Covert Operation": Modern versions of the theory argue that the government is already conducting "geoengineering" to combat climate change in secret, using planes to create an artificial cloud cover that reflects sunlight back into space.
337. The "Owning the Weather in 2025" Military Paper: Adherents frequently cite a 1996 U.S. Air Force research paper as a "blueprint" for using weather modification as a weapon, despite the military’s stance that the document was a fictionalized brainstorm of future strategic possibilities.
338. The "Linger and Spread" Distinction: Believers argue that "real" contrails (condensation trails) should dissipate in seconds, and any trail that lingers for hours or spreads into a hazy cloud layer is definitive proof of chemical additives designed to "blanket" the sky.
339. The "Clear Skies Act" and State Bans (2024–2025): By late 2025, several U.S. states, including Tennessee and Utah, passed or introduced legislation to ban "atmospheric geoengineering," directly fueled by public pressure from chemtrail activists.
340. The RFK Jr. "Task Force" Investigation (2025): In late 2025, reports emerged that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. planned to form a federal task force to investigate "chemtrails" and the presence of heavy metals in jet fuel, bringing the theory into mainstream government discourse.
341. The "Smart Dust" and Neural Interface Theory: A more extreme variation alleges that chemtrails contain "nano-aluminum" or "smart dust" that, once inhaled, can be activated by 5G towers or HAARP (High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program) for mass mind control.
342. The "Global Dimming" and Food Supply Narrative: Some theorists believe the primary goal is to block sunlight to reduce crop yields and make the population dependent on GMO "sun-resistant" seeds produced by major agricultural corporations.
343. The "Biological Warfare" and Human Sedation Plot: Older versions of the theory suggest the chemicals are designed to sedate the population, lower fertility rates, or test new biological pathogens on unsuspecting citizens to benefit the pharmaceutical industry.
344. The "Make Sunsets" Private Geoengineering Scare: In 2024 and 2025, the activities of private startups attempting to release sulfur-filled balloons to "cool the Earth" were used by theorists as proof that the larger, state-sponsored "chemtrail" program has existed for decades.
345. The "Mud Flood" Cataclysm: The central claim that a global catastrophe (the "Mud Flood") occurred in the mid-1800s, burying the first floors of Tartarian buildings in several feet of earth; theorists point to "half-buried" basement windows in older cities as proof that these were originally ground-level entrances.
346. The "Free Energy" Antiquity-Tech: Adherents believe Tartarian architecture—specifically domes, spires, and "power station" cathedrals—was designed to harvest atmospheric electricity; they claim the ornate metal finials on old buildings were actually wireless energy receivers.
347. The "Giant" Founders Theory: Based on the massive scale of doors, ceilings, and "oversized" steps in neoclassical buildings like the U.S. Capitol, some theorists argue that Tartaria was populated by a race of giants who were eventually "culled" or died out during the mud flood.
348. The "Star Fort" Energy Network: Proponents claim that star-shaped fortifications found globally (like Fort McHenry) were not for military defense but were sophisticated "frequency resonators" or water-processing plants that formed a global energy grid.
349. The World’s Fair "Demolition" Plot: Theorists argue that the 19th-century World’s Fairs (like the 1915 San Francisco Panama-Pacific International Exposition) were actually existing Tartarian cities that were co-opted, used for propaganda, and then intentionally dynamited to hide the true history of the "Old World."
350. The "Orphan Train" Repopulation Narrative: To explain how history was reset, some suggest that the "Orphan Trains" of the late 1800s were used to distribute a "blank slate" generation of children into the excavated Tartarian ruins to be raised with a false, manufactured history.
351. The "Relabeling" of Maps: Adherents cite 17th and 18th-century maps labeling the region of North Asia as "Tartary" or "Grand Tartaria" as smoking-gun evidence of a suppressed sovereign empire, ignoring that "Tartary" was a common European geographical term for the region, similar to "The Orient."
352. The "Reset" of 1851: Many theorists identify the year 1851 (the year of the first World's Fair in London) as the official "start date" of the current manufactured timeline, claiming everything prior to this date was part of the "Great Reset" that erased Tartaria.
353. The "Ancient Aryan" Occult Origins: While globalized today, the theory has roots in Russian "New Chronology" and nationalist pseudoscience, which claims Tartaria was the original name for a superior "Aryan-Slavic" empire that the West maliciously "deleted" from books.
354. The "Red Brick" Battery Theory: A fringe belief within the community that the red bricks used in Gilded Age architecture were specifically engineered with iron oxide to act as capacitors for storing harvested atmospheric energy.
355. The Phantom Time Hypothesis (614–911 AD): Proposed by Heribert Illig in 1991, this theory claims that nearly 300 years were artificially added to the Early Middle Ages, meaning we are currently living in the 1700s rather than the 2000s.
356. The "Millennium Fabrication" Plot: Illig alleges that Holy Roman Emperor Otto III and Pope Sylvester II conspired to rewrite history retroactively so they could reign during the symbolic year 1000 AD, thereby legitimizing Otto’s claim to a divine empire.
357. The Charlemagne "Ghost" Claim: A central tenet of Phantom Time is that the Emperor Charlemagne never existed but was a fictional character invented to fill the three-century gap with a glorious, manufactured heroic past.
358. The "Shortened" New Chronology: Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko argues that all of ancient history (Greece, Rome, and Egypt) actually occurred in the Middle Ages and that recorded history only truly began around 800 AD.
359. The "Great Russian Horde" Empire: Fomenko claims that prior to the 17th century, a massive Eurasian empire called the "Russian Horde" ruled the world, and its history was later "deleted" or reattributed to Western civilizations by the Vatican and the Romanov
360. dynasty.
361. The "Jesus in the 12th Century" Theory: Within New Chronology, Fomenko asserts that the historical Jesus was born in 1152 AD in Crimea and was crucified in 1185 AD near Constantinople, claiming the biblical narrative is a "reflection" of medieval events.
362. The "Doublet" and "Parallelism" Method: Fomenko uses statistical "parallelism" to claim that different historical figures (e.g., various Roman Emperors and English Kings) are actually the same person appearing multiple times in a "stretched" and falsified timeline.
363. The "Constantinople as Jerusalem" Narrative: New Chronology adherents believe that the biblical Jerusalem was actually Constantinople and that the Temple of Solomon is the Hagia Sophia, with the modern city of Jerusalem being a "fake" site created to match a forged history.
364. regorian Calendar "Three-Day Shortfall": Illig cites the 1582 Gregorian calendar reform as proof of missing time, arguing that the 10-day adjustment made by the Pope should have been 13 days if the Julian calendar had truly been running since 45 BC.
365. The "Scarcity of Evidence" Argument: Both theories rely on the lack of archaeological "refuse" and architectural evolution during the "Dark Ages," claiming this "archaeological silence" proves those centuries simply never happened.
366. The Garry Kasparov Endorsement: The world chess champion has famously supported Fomenko’s New Chronology, arguing that many ancient manuscripts are actually Renaissance forgeries and that his own "mathematical intuition" leads him to doubt the conventional timeline.
367.
